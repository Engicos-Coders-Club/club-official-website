## Introduction

This project is build using basic React.js architecture. The plan and prototype for the project is described on the excalidraw Live collaboration Sketch. Feel free to give you suggestion in the excalidraw plan. If you cant able to open the online collaboration link of Excalidraw plan, you can use Excalidraw extension in vscode to open and edit the plan.


### Current Plan

Our project's blueprint and structural planning are currently in progress through live collaboration on Excalidraw. Excalidraw provides a dynamic environment for team members to collectively sketch out the website's layout, sections, and content flow. This collaborative process ensures that everyone's input is considered, resulting in a well-organized and comprehensive structure.

In future for UI desings suggestions and UI planing we can move to more efficient and feature reach tools to have proper and detailed plan and to have seamingless collaboration and exchange of ideas. Any suggestions for the same will be highly appreciated.

We understand that collaboration and design are iterative processes. As we progress, we'll continuously seek your feedback and input to refine the blueprint, structure, and UI design. Our goal is to create a website that aligns with your vision and effectively communicates your message to your audience.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
Make sure you have [node js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed 

You can use [bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) (only for Linux and MacOS users) too I've set the enviroment up for it too

Install typescript

cloning and installing this repo should install typescript locally but if you wish to install it globally run

```bash
npm install -g typescript 
```


Clone this repo and switch to this branch (next-ts)

Clone:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Engicos-Coders-Club/club-official-website.git
```

then switch branch 

Switch to next-ts:
```bash
git checkout next-ts
```

once switched, install the necessary packages by using this command

Install commands:
```bash
npm install 
```
or 
```bash
npm i
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

To convert tsx to jsx use:
```bash
npm run transpile
```
